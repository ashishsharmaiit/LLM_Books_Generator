This was a side project to generate short books from OpenAI APIs. 

The user experience is 
1. User enters the topics, that the user wants to read the books on.
2. User sees titles of different books on the topics that are generated by LLM in real-time.
3. User clicks on a book to see it's description. User confirms that they want to read this book.
4. User goes to the book reading page, and reads the book. The API divides the topic into 10 chapters and generates these chapters one by one.

The frontend was coded in React, while the backend is coded in python.
