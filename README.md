This was a side project to generate short books of 10 chapters on any topic that person wants to read on. The books were generated using LLM via OpenAI APIs. 

The user experience is 
1. User enters the topics, that the user wants to read the books on.
2. User sees titles of different books on the topics that are generated by LLM in real-time.
3. User clicks on a book to see it's description. User confirms that they want to read this book.
4. User sees a table of content of 10 chapters of the book. LLM divides the topic into 10 chapters for the book.
5. User reads the chapter one by one, where content is generated by the LLM.


The frontend was coded in React, while the backend is coded in python.
